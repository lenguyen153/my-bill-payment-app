## üöÄ How to Run the Project

The included Maven Wrapper scripts (`mvnw` for Linux/macOS and `mvnw.cmd` for Windows) will handle downloading the correct Maven version and running the project.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/lenguyen153/my-bill-payment-app.git](https://github.com/lenguyen153/my-bill-payment-app.git)
    cd my-bill-payment-app
    ```

2.  **Compile and Run the Application**
    Use the following Maven command to compile and run the project in your terminal.

    * On macOS or Linux:
        ```sh
        ./mvnw compile exec:java
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```sh
        mvnw.cmd compile exec:java
        ```

    The application will start, and you will see the welcome message and available commands.

## ‚úÖ How to Test the Project

To run the complete suite of unit tests, use the Maven Wrapper's `test` command.

1.  **Open a terminal** in the project's root directory.

2.  **Execute the test command**:

    * On macOS or Linux:
        ```sh
        ./mvnw test
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```sh
        mvnw.cmd test
        ```
    Maven will compile the code and run all tests. You will see a `BUILD SUCCESS` message if all tests pass.
